wonder-word
===========
Preparing for GRE and TOEFL? Or maybe you just are a vocabulary NERD? Then, here is a wonderful tool at your disposal. 

(Optional) Dependency for Mac
-----------------------------
On Mac, you can install this Dictionary plugin for your native OSX dictionary: https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary

Using this plugin, you can bookmark words in your dictionary.app, which our `ww` app will then retrieve.

Installation
------------
Install it using the following command:

    sudo -H pip install https://github.com/shraddha-hna/wonder-word

Then, fire up the following command and see the "wonder":

    ww

Currently, it's not available in python PIP. I will soon upload it there too.
